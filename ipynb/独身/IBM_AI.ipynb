    "Yamaguchi City, Tsuwano, Sakai City, and Takehara City, Hiroshima Prefecture, I went on a trip (all Kyoto City). On the way from the sushi to Takefuhara, I also stopped in Shinyu country and visited the Kintaru Bridge. After Takehara, I stayed at the house of Okayama's relative. Sightseeing in Yamaguchi City is convenient for Yamaguchi Station, so stay at the hotel. However, next to Yamaguchi Station, there is a Yoda hot spring, eating and drinking locals, and I think that there is a lot of shops in the Yoda Onsen, and go out with a bicycle borrowed at the hotel. I stayed for 2 nights in Yamaguchi City, but the first night was taken to a haunted hand-shaped Yuta store, which was introduced at the tourist information center. I wanted to go to this store on the second night's day, but on Sunday. In addition, I tried to introduce it at the tourist information center, but it was closed.
